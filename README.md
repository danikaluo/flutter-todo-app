Reflection: What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

Flutter has the ability to create cross-platform applications using a single codebase. With one tool, you can develop separate apps for the web, mobile, and desktop easily. Flutter consists of a framework built with Dart not Javascript. It does have a lot of the same functionality in terms of creating components and adding style. Flutter also has a lot of widgets. I also found that the Hot Reloading feature was very useful so that whenever the code was saved, I could see all the changes instantly. The setup process did involve a lot of installations which was more complicated than using previous technologies.
